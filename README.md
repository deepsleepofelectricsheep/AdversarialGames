# Adversarial games

This repo contains my explorations of adversarial games, based on the content covered in Stanford's CS221: AI Principles and Techniques. I really enjoyed learning to model deterministic games as trees and applying tree search, particularly MiniMax, to solve them. Here I aim to model and solve games, simple and complex, such as Tic-tac-toe and Quoridor, applying techniques learned in class and beyond. I hope you'll enjoy my learning journey.
